Bare metal arduino (atmega328) games console. I've been inspired by Ben Heck's channel on youtube "attiny10 games console". His was implementing NTSC video signal and space invaders style game. Here we attempt a similar thing but with PAL tv output and a much bigger micro controllerr... should be easy right??
